# JavaScript Calculator & Weather Widget

This repository contains two distinct web development projects showcasing client-side scripting with JavaScript: a real-time calculator and a dynamic weather display widget.

## üßÆ JavaScript Calculator

A basic calculator implemented entirely in JavaScript.

* **Functionality:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two input numbers.
* **Real-time Updates:** Displays results instantly as numbers or operations are changed, without requiring a page refresh.
* **Self-Contained:** All logic is embedded directly within the HTML, with no external server requests after the initial page load.
* **Event Handling:** Demonstrates proper event listener binding in JavaScript to separate behavior from HTML.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Widget

A web-based widget that fetches and displays current weather forecasts.

* **Data Fetching:** Uses AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests to retrieve weather data in JSON format from a specified server.
* **Dynamic Display:** Processes the JSON response to dynamically update HTML, displaying:
    * Location (City, State)
    * Humidity
    * Current Temperature
    * Images for tomorrow's and the day after tomorrow's forecast.
* **Automatic & Manual Refresh:** Initializes automatically on page load and can be manually refreshed via a button.
* **Styling:** Incorporates an external CSS file for a polished appearance.
