# Calendar Web Application

This project is a dynamic web-based calendar that allows users to manage their personal events. It provides a month-by-month view with navigation, user authentication, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for events, all without page reloads.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Month View Navigation:** Users can browse months forward and backward indefinitely.
* **User Accounts:** Supports user registration and secure login.
* **Personalized Events:** Registered users can add, view, edit, and delete only their own events.
* **Unregistered Access:** Unregistered users can view the calendar structure but not any events.
* **Dynamic Interactions:** All user interactions, including registration, login, and event management, are handled client-side using JavaScript and AJAX requests, ensuring a seamless user experience.
* **Persistent Data:** All user and event data is securely stored in a MySQL database.

## üîí Security Highlights

Security was a core focus in the development of this application:

* **XSS Prevention:** Input is carefully handled and output is sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
* **CSRF Protection:** Anti-Cross-Site Request Forgery tokens are implemented in all forms and AJAX requests.
* **SQL Injection Prevention:** All database queries utilize prepared statements.
* **Secure Authentication:** Passwords are securely hashed and salted before storage in the database.
* **Session Security:** Session cookies are set as HTTP-Only to mitigate session hijacking risks.
* **W3C Compliance:** The application adheres to W3C validation standards.
